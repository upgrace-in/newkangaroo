        <h3>About Us</h3>
        <p>
          Kangaroo Kulture is the blueprint to kick off our future ambitions. We are an NFT project that is supporting
          REAL living creatures in our hostile world. We want to give back to our NFT owners with generous ETH drops and
          hidden surprises as well as supporting wild life sanctuary's across the world. Kangaroo Kulture will be
          donating 10% of profits to our chosen sanctuary in Australia. (please follow our twitter for live updates) Our
          aim is to make this a successful project and to expand with a much larger project in the near future. We
          already in talks with future partners who we will be collaborating with soon to come. These names will work
          hand in hand with us and bring much more attention to our project on a greater scale. They will reach out to
          even the people who have very little knowledge of NFT's, Organically growing our platform. We want more than
          just Kangaroo's saved, we want all wildlife in need to be supported. This makes Kangaroo Kulture an exciting
          place to start and we are sure you can imagine how many animals we can introduce into future projects and far
          more donations to sanctuary's across the world ! You aren't just helping wildlife, you're literally being a
          piece of a big puzzle to bring global awareness and you're owning a very important NFT with huge growth and
          potential.
